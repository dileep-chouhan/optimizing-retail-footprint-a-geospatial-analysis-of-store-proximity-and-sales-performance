# Optimizing Retail Footprint: A Geospatial Analysis of Store Proximity and Sales Performance

## Overview

This project performs a geospatial analysis to optimize a retail company's footprint.  The analysis leverages existing store location data, sales performance metrics, and customer density information to identify optimal locations for new store openings and potential closures.  The goal is to maximize profitability by minimizing redundancy and maximizing market penetration.  The analysis incorporates techniques to assess store proximity, market saturation, and sales correlation with geographical factors.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Geopandas (likely, depending on data format)
* [Add other libraries as needed]


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You may need to adjust file paths within `main.py` to point to your data files.  The data files (e.g., store locations, sales data, customer density data) are assumed to be in the `data/` directory.  Ensure these files are correctly formatted and placed before running the script.


## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the geospatial analysis to the console, including summaries of store proximity, sales performance correlations, and potential recommendations for new store openings or closures.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., maps showing store locations, sales heatmaps, etc.) in the `output/` directory.  These visualizations aid in the understanding of the analysis results.  Example output files might include:

* `store_proximity_map.png` (Illustrates the proximity of existing stores)
* `sales_heatmap.png` (Visualizes sales performance across the geographical area)
* `potential_locations.csv` (A list of potential locations for new stores, based on the analysis)
